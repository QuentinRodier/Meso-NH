!!****  *INI_STAND_ATM* - initialization of 5 standard atmospheres
!!
!!    PURPOSE
!!    -------
!!      The purpose of this routine is to initialize the tropical,
!!    summer/winter mid-latitudes and summer/winter polar standard atmospheres
!!
!!**  METHOD
!!    ------
!!      Each atmosphere is defined on 31 levels from 0 to 50 Km. For each level
!!    is given the height in km, the pressure in mbar, the temperature in K, the
!!    air density in kg/m3, the vapor content in kg/m3 and the ozone content in
!!    kg/m3
!!
!!    EXTERNAL
!!    --------
!!      None
!!
!!**  IMPLICIT ARGUMENTS
!!    ------------------
!!      Module MODD_STAND_ATM : declares 5 arrays of standard atmospheres
