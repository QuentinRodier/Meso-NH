#
# II) Installation from a packed tar.gz file, created with "conda pack"
#     for Linux Supercomputer without internet connection

# I)  Installation from scratch,  on your PC for example
# =======================================================

# I- a) Installation of mini-conda
----------------------------------

# If you don't have already the "conda" command in your PC
# first install "miniconda"

# Creation of the install directory, for example in your $HOME :

export MNH_MINICONDA=${HOME}/MINICONDA
mkdir -p ${MNH_MINICONDA}
cd ${MNH_MINICONDA}

# get/install the last version of miniconda for X64 ( here with python 3.9 )

wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-py39_4.9.2-Linux-x86_64.sh

# during the installation
# - accept the licence -> yes
# - give the path of installation > #path -> /home/{your_login}/PATCH/MINICONDA/miniconda3


# when installed initialization of miniconda

source ${MNH_MINICONDA}/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh

# REM : the other solution is via "conda init bash"  which changes the "~/.bashrc"
#       but I don't like it ...

# I- b) Creation of the conda environment "mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# Now , creation of the conda environment "mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata"
# /!\ about 3Go of disk space are needed
#

conda create -n mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata
conda activate mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata
conda install -c conda-forge netcdf4 cartopy matlibplot

#
# this is the minimum packages needed for the MesoNH script of the test cases
#

#
# for computer without internet connection ( for example compute nodes of super computers )
# you could add this package to download in advance cartopy data files
#

conda install -c conda-forge cartopy_offlinedata

# REM : this files add about 2OO Mo and are located in "$CONDA_PREFIX/share/cartopy"
        ( CONDA_PREFIX is set when you initialize/ source the (mini)conda command

# I-c) Using the environment with mesonh
-----------------------------------------

#
# Now to use this conda environment with MesoNH , the best way is to put
# these lines at the end of your "profile_mesonh{the_good_one}"
#

export MNH_MINICONDA=${HOME}/MINICONDA
source ${MNH_MINICONDA}/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata

# and then use mesonh as usual by sourcing this file

cd .../MNH.../conf
. profile_mesonh{the_good_one}


# I-d) Optional: export the environment with "conda pack"
-----------------------------------------------------------

#
# After this, if you were to export your binary installation in a "tar.gz" file to another 'compatible' computer
# first add the 'conda-pack' package

conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack

# And now export the environment with 

conda pack -n mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata -o mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata.tar.gz

# II) Installation from a packed tar.gz file , created with "conda pack"
#     for Linux Supercomputer without internet connection
=========================================================

#
# On Supercomputer without internet connection  , like TGCC/CEA Irene or CINES/Occigen
# you could not install package with the conda command.
# As a work-around you could download and use a "tar.gz" as prepared on my Linux OpenSuse PC .
# ( as explained in the previous sessions )
#
# REM : you don't need to load any 'module files' like python to do this work-around
#       <-> no conda/python needed in your PATH


# First, on your PC computer download the "tar.gz" I prepared and uploaded on the MesoNH web page

wget   http://mesonh.aero.obs-mip.fr/mesonh/tmp/MINICONDA/mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata.tar.gz


# Then, to use it for example on Irene or Occigen computer 
# Copy the "tar.gz" for you PC to Super computer in $CCCWORKDIR (or  $WORKDIR ) :

# From your PC

scp mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata.tar.gz irene:.

# On Irene

cd $CCCWORKDIR
mv ~/mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata.tar.gz $CCCWORKDIR/.
mkdir mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata
> tar xvf mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata.tar.gz -C mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata

# Activation of the package, for example at the end of your "profile_mesonh{the_good_one}

source $CCCWORKDIR/mnh_conda_cartopy_offlinedata/bin/activate

# That's all, you can now use the packages included in the "tar.gz"
#/!\
#/!\ Warning: you don't have "conda" so you cannot modify this installation/package  .
#/!\

Good tests .
